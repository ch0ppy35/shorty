# Shorty, the serverless link shortener

This is a serverless implementation of my [pyTinifier](https://github.com/mmillerlevels/pyTinifier) app I build a while back in Flask.

This isn't a monolith, so it's more efficiant!

## Todo

This is purely an api right now. Need to get a UI for this yet.

## Requirements

- An AWS account (Make sure you've got your creds configured on your machine)
- Have the serverless framework installed `npm install -g serverless`
- Run `npm install serverless-python-individually` you'll need this too for this implementation
